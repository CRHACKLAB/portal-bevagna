<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Tells browser engine that it can use the pure standard specifics and it does not need to use less efficient 'quirk-modes' for markup interpretation.

<html lang="en"> <!--Lang must be there for accessibility reason and help screen-readers or the like to analyze content. Reminder: it can be applied to most tags. For example, if you have a <p> in Italian, you should actually write <p lang="it"> to make a screen-reader aware that it is about to interpret a different language. All the more useful since the :lang CSS pseudo-class exists-->
